# OPSA400M

## Background

This repository was created after two years of development done without git, which is why there are several physical versions of the code in here.

## Goal and use

The goal is now to stop duplicating the code by versionning it on github. 

The new users should use their own fork to develop at their ease, then they should push their work on the main fork once it's working.

### **__I recommand using only the folder "OPSA400M en cours"__**

__Please be careful not to overwrite the existing code. Learn to use git before squashing or force pushing, which can have devastating effects.__

In any case, learning how to use git is always useful for any engineer.

## GOOD LUCK WITH THIS MESSY APPLICATION!
